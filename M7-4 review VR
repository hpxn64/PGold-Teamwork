Layout: 
Could have used the same css file for every branch so that everything has the same layout or at least more similar layout. 
On the summary/evaluation page there could have been more paragraphs so that it is easier to read. 
Really like how you have used the pictures as a background and in the web page. Looks really cool!
Code: 
Looks really good from what I can see!
General: 
You did a realy good job!!!
Don't really want to mark it but you get a good 90:)
